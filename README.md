## How to use
When the user loads the RecipEasy app, they are presented with a variety of randomly selected recipes for cooking inspo. The user can select one of these presented recipes, or if something in particular sounds good, they can search for it in the top search bar. Once a recipe is selected, a card opens showing the recipe title, an image of the meal, and a list of ingredients with a checklist. The user can check off whatever items they already have on hand before heading to the grocery store. When ready to get shopping, the user clicks Get Shoppin! to open a modal that holds an image that when clicked will launch an API call to Google Maps. Within the API call, the users location is automatically gathered as well as the call specifies to locate grocery stores only. The user is directed upon clicking on the map image within the map modal to Google Maps to select the grocery store of their choice and get further directions. If at any time the user wants to re-navigate to Google Maps, they can click on ‘Locations’ in the top nav bar of the main page.

The user can then continue to use their ingredient checklist at the store to ensure that they have everything they’ll need to get cooking. Once ready, the user clicks Get Cookin! to switch from viewing ingredients to viewing a checklist of recipe instructions. If desired, the user can select the button from the instructions page to make a diary entry. This prompts a diary entry modal where the user can record if they would like to make the recipe again (yes or no), how they rate the recipe (scale from 1 to 5), and can make free-form notes in the ‘Your Recipe Notes’ section. The user can reference their diary entries at any time by clicking ‘Diary’ in the top nav bar.

RecipEasy makes it easy to find recipes, know what ingredients are needed, know where to get said ingredients, see how to make your meal, and keep a diary of what you’ve made for future reference.

## Feedback
This project offered the opportunity to see how others conceptualized and executed ideas, and allowed us to collaborate to achieve a shared vision. The biggest learning curve for our team was working in GitHub with branches and merging changes. It was fascinating to see our work come together and we are pleased to see our ideas come to life with RecipEasy! 

## TPM
From a TPM perspective, this project was well organized and documented. We planned prior to starting to code and thoroughly wrote out our MVP, wireframing, nice-to-haves, and other pertinent information to the project. We managed our Kanban board on GitHub. This was where the biggest road-block of the project came in as the GitHub master at some point removed the board. We were still able to access and view issues on GitHub, and thankfully had been keeping a.m. and p.m. stand-up recaps via Slack, and so we still had documentation to keep us running, but it was difficult to have lost visibility into much of what had already been done and specific tasks that had been added there. I believe this occurred simply as a GitHub learning curve for the individual. As the PM, my take-away was to be sure to document in more than one place, and to have the right person as the GitHub master.

For this project we divided tasks by front-end and back-end. Modularization worked well for this team and the end result was not only the originally planned MVP, but some of the nice-to-haves as well. Specifically the diary was a nice-to-have and we feel it adds a lot of personality to the app.
